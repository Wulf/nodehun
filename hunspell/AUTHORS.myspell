Developer Credits:

Special credit and thanks go to ispell's creator Geoff Kuenning.  
Ispell affix compression code was used as the basis for the 
affix code used in MySpell. Specifically Geoff's use of a 
conds[] array that makes it easy to check if the conditions 
required for a particular affix are present was very 
ingenious! Kudos to Geoff.  Very nicely done.  
BTW: ispell is available under a BSD style license

Kevin Hendricks <kevin.hendricks@sympatico.ca> is the original 
author and now maintainer of the MySpell codebase.  Recent 
additions include ngram support, and related character maps 
to help improve and create suggestions for very poorly 
spelled words. 

Please send any and all contributions or improvements
to him or to dev@lingucomponent.openoffice.org.


David Einstein (Deinst@world.std.com) developed an almost
complete rewrite of MySpell for use by the Mozilla project.
David and I are now working on parallel development tracks 
to help our respective projects (Mozilla and OpenOffice.org) 
and we will maintain full affix file and dictionary file 
compatibility and work on merging our versions of MySpell 
back into a single tree. David has been a significant help 
in improving MySpell.


Németh László <nemethl@gyorsposta.hu> is the author of 
the Hungarian dictionary and he developed and contributed
extensive changes to MySpell including ... 
  * code to support compound words in MySpell
  * fixed numerous problems with encoding case conversion tables. 
  * designed/developed replacement tables to improve suggestions
  * changed affix file parsing to trees to greatly speed loading
  * removed the need for malloc/free pairs in suffix_check which
      speeds up spell checking in suffix rich languages by 20%

Davide Prina <davideprina@uahoo.com>, Giuseppe Modugno 
<gppe.modugno@libero.it>, Gianluca Turconi <luctur@comeg.it> 
all from the it_IT OpenOffice.org team performed an 
extremely  detailed code review of MySpell and generated
fixes for bugs, leaks, and speedup improvements. 

Simon Brouwer <simon.oo.o@xs4all.nl> for fixes and enhancements
that have greatly improved MySpell auggestions
  * n-gram suggestions for an initcap word have an init. cap. 
  * fix for too many n-gram suggestions from specialized dictionary,
  * fix for long suggestions rather than close ones in case of 
      dictionaries with many compound words (kompuuter)
  * optionally disabling split-word suggestions (controlled 
      by NOSPLITSUGS line in affix file)


Special Thanks to all others who have either contributed ideas or
testing for MySpell
