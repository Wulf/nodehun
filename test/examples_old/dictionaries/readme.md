Dictionaries
------------
The included dictionaries where extracted from Libre Office. The Libre Office versions have a modified aff file that makes generate() and analyze() much more useful. However, any MySpell style dictionary will work. Here are a few sources:

* [Libre Office dictionaries](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/dictionaries/tree/)
* [Official Aspell dictionaries](http://wordlist.aspell.net/dicts/)
* [Open Office extensions](http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/dictionary)
* [Mozilla Extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/language-tools/)
